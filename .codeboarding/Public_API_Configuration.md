## Details

The `perforatedai` subsystem, designed as a Deep Learning Library/Research Toolkit, is structured around a modular and API-centric approach. Its core functionality is exposed through a public API, which orchestrates interactions with specialized internal components for model management, neuron layer tracking, and general utilities, all while centralizing configuration.

### Public API & Configuration [[Expand]](./Public_API_Configuration.md)
Serves as the primary interface for users to interact with the library, exposing core functionalities and managing global settings and hyperparameters. It acts as the central orchestrator for high-level operations.
