The project establishes a clean training and validation pipeline for image classification with experiment tracking using Weights & Biases.

## Key Features
- Vision model training and validation
- Epoch-wise metric tracking
- Reproducible experiment logging
- Hackathon-ready structure

## Built With
- PyTorch
- Torchvision
- Weights & Biases
- Python
- Google Colab

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies
2. Run the notebook cells in order
3. View metrics on Weights & Biases dashboard
