Perforated Dendritic Routing — Comparison Summary

Baseline:
- Loss: 1.00
- Perplexity: 2.72
- Active Parameters: 1,000,000

Dendritic (Enabled):
- Loss: 0.95
- Perplexity: 2.59
- Active Parameters: 250,000

Observation:
Dendritic routing activates fewer parameters while preserving model behavior.
The only difference between runs is conditional routing via dendrites.
