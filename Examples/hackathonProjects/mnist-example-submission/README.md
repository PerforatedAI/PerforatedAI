# Example Hackathon Project

## Intro - Required

Description:

This folder shows what a hackathon project should look like. Each submission must be made as a pull request to the `main` branch of this repository. Check out the repo, create a new folder inside the `Examples/hackathonProjects` folder, and place your code there. The code can link to other repositories, but the submission must be included here in this format.

The intro additionally should include your team information.

Example Content:

MNIST is a standard dataset used to demonstrate proof-of-concept for new tools. This hackathon submission tests adding dendrites to the MNIST example from PyTorch.

Team:

Name - Position/Company - contact info optional

## Project Impact - Required

Description:

The Project Impact section should describe why this matters. A short paragraph (a few sentences) is sufficient to explain why improved accuracy or compressed models would matter for this application.

Example Content:

MNIST is a dataset for OCR. Improving the accuracy of an OCR system matters because it ensures that text extracted from images or documents is reliable, reducing errors in data processing and analysis. Higher accuracy also saves time and costs by minimizing the need for manual corrections or reprocessing. In fields like finance, healthcare, and legal work, precise text recognition is critical since even small mistakes can lead to serious misinterpretations or compliance issues.

## Usage Instructions - Required

Description:

Each project must include instructions for how to install and run the project.

The only exeception to this is is you are in a lab or company that is working with proprietary data or models that are not able to be open sourced.  If that is the case a PR will not be required, but we will require permission to formally include your company or lab in any publications or related media we produce related to the hackathon.

Example Content:

Installation:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Run:

    PAIPASSWORD=123 CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python mnist_perforatedai_wandb.py --count 25

## Results - Required

Description:

Each project must have results. The minimum must be included:

- Accuracy Projects
  - The accuracy of the final dendritic network
  - The accuracy of that same architecture with the same settings without dendrites (If you look at `PAI/PAIbest_test_scores.csv` this will show the original architecture's scores)
  - Optional - The accuracy of the original network, or other optimal non-dendritic architectures
  - Remaining Error Reduction
    - This is the percentage of remaining error that dendrites reduced. For example, if adding dendrites improves accuracy from 90% to 92%, that is a 20% Remaining Error Reduction. The error drops from 10% to 8%. That 2-percentage-point drop means dendrites eliminated 20% of the original error.
- Compression Projects
  - The accuracy and parameter count of the optimal non-dendritic model
  - The accuracy and parameter count of the final dendritic network
  - The accuracy and parameter count of that same architecture with the same settings without dendrites (If you look at `PAI/PAIbest_test_scores.csv` this will show the original architecture's scores)
  - Percent Parameter Reduction

Example Content:

This MNIST example shows that Dendritic Optimization can improve accuracy on MNIST. Comparing the best traditional model to the best dendritic model below:

| Model        | Final Validation Score |  Notes  |
|--------------|------------------------| ------- |
| Traditional  | 99.26                  | Optional Notes here |
| Dendritic    | 99.42                  | Such as network hyperparameters |

This provides a Remaining Error Reduction of **21.6%**.

## Raw Results Graph - Required

Description:

When running our library, output graphs are automatically generated. By default they are saved in the `PAI` folder, but you can also change the filename with the `save_name` parameter when calling `initialize_pai`. The final graph generated by training will be `PAI/PAI.png` by default, and it shows the final results of the training run you are submitting. **It is absolutely mandatory that you include this file.** Without it there is no way to verify that your project actually added dendrites correctly. Before awarding prizes, we will run your code and confirm your results; however, if this file is not included we will not be able to confirm reproduction. Another reason this is required is that it is the only way you can be sure things are working properly. If you do not check it you might not realize your project is incomplete. Please take a look at [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HygopGvDopYEF_rBlQvSbifgK-3GgQqnerX7yVngvHs/edit?usp=sharing), which includes examples of problems you might run into and how they will look on this graph. The closer your graph looks to the "What a Good Graph Should Look Like" example, the better. If your graph has any of the other problems it will impact your score. If this graph is not included, or if your graph looks like the "No Dendrites" graph, your submission will not be judged. The important graph is the top-left graph in the image. The red vertical lines will only be present for CC dendrites if you requested a PAI license; requesting a license is not required to be eligible for prizes. The form to request a license is here: https://share.hsforms.com/1meVnVMXtQTiUDm6WWKLGDgrzzmm

## Clean Results Graph - Optional

Description:

If you would like to provide a condensed graph that can help visualize the full impact of dendrites. To generate a graph, please use the [results graph template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SuCrKkS7uzGQSlKniL3OtjIZEcyeW93isHkl6FIgL-0/edit?usp=sharing).

## Weights and Biases Sweep Report - Optional

Description:

A Weights and Biases sweep report is an ideal way to show that you experimented thoroughly. It can display, with clear visuals, the outcomes of each of your experiments so judges can see exactly how dendrites affected your model and dataset. Having this will grant bonus points from the judges, but it is not mandatory for submission or to win our top prizes. Reach out if you have any trouble creating a Weights and Biases account.

## Additional Files - Optional

Your code must be runnable; files can be included here or linked elsewhere. Please include them here if there are only a few files, and provide a link to your code only if it is a fork of another large repository. In addition to this README and the code required to run the project, it is helpful to include any original files that show what you started from and what the project looked like before adding dendrites. A `requirements.txt` file is also helpful for installation.
