Some weights of ViTForImageClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k and are newly initialized: ['classifier.bias', 'classifier.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.

The following module has not properly set this_output_dimensions
.vit.encoder.layer.11.output.dense
it is expecting:
tensor([-1,  0])
but received
torch.Size([32, 197, 768])
to check these all at once set GPA.pc.set_debugging_output_dimensions(1)
Call MODEL_VARIABLE.vit.encoder.layer.11.output.dense.set_this_output_dimensions([...]) on this module after initialize_pai
