Perforated NeuroShrink

Intro:
Perforated NeuroShrink is a hackathon project demonstrating dendritic optimization using the official PerforatedAI framework.
The project showcases the complete dendritic optimization lifecycle, including:

Phase-1: Dendritic capacity injection
Phase-2: Validation-driven adaptive restructuring

Dendritic optimization is applied to a standard PyTorch convolutional neural network without modifying the model architecture, highlighting how PerforatedAI can be integrated into existing models with minimal code changes.
This submission is included in the Examples/hackathonProjects folder as required and is fully reproducible.

Team:
Vishal Prakash — Student / Independent Researcher

Project Impact:
Neural networks are often over-parameterized, which increases computation cost, memory usage, and makes deployment on edge or low-resource hardware difficult.
Dendritic optimization addresses this challenge by enabling adaptive computation and dynamic restructuring during training. By injecting dendritic capacity and restructuring the network based on validation feedback, PerforatedAI prepares models for reduced effective computation, future compression, and cost-efficient deployment.
This approach is particularly relevant for edge AI, real-time inference systems, and scenarios where computational efficiency is critical.

Usage Instructions:
Installation

Clone the PerforatedAI repository and install the framework in editable mode:
git clone https://github.com/PerforatedAI/PerforatedAI.git
cd PerforatedAI
pip install -e .

Run the Project
Navigate to the project folder:
cd Examples/hackathonProjects/perforated-neuroshrink

Run the Phase-2 demonstration script:
python train_phase2.py

Results:
This project focuses on framework correctness and adaptive behavior rather than claiming final accuracy or compression benchmarks.

Summary of Observed Behavio:r
Aspect	Observation
Model Architecture	Standard CNN (unchanged)
Phase-1 Dendrites	Successfully initialized
Phase-2 Restructuring	Triggered via validation feedback
Adaptive Behavior	Confirmed during runtime
Framework API Used	Official initialize_pai
Runtime Confirmation

During training, the PerforatedAI tracker reports successful adaptive restructuring:
>>> MODEL RESTRUCTURED (Phase 2 triggered)
This confirms that the model undergoes validation-driven adaptive restructuring, demonstrating the intended two-phase dendritic optimization workflow.

Additional Notes:
This submission follows the official PerforatedAI hackathon project structure.
The project uses the official PerforatedAI API without modifying internal library code.
The demo emphasizes correct framework usage, reproducibility, and lifecycle understanding.
The project is intended as a framework demonstration and case study, rather than a final performance benchmark.

Future Work:
Future extensions of this project could include systematic benchmarking of dendritic optimization across different architectures and datasets. This would allow quantitative evaluation of accuracy, parameter efficiency, and computational cost under controlled experimental settings.
Additional work may explore hyperparameter sweeps using tools such as Weights & Biases to better understand the interaction between dendritic capacity, restructuring schedules, and training dynamics.
Finally, integrating dendritic optimization into larger models or alternative frameworks could further demonstrate its applicability to real-world, resource-constrained deployment scenarios.
