# Dendritic YOLOv8 - Edge Object Detection Optimization

## Intro - Required

This hackathon submission applies PerforatedAI's dendritic optimization to YOLOv8n for improved edge deployment efficiency. YOLOv8 is the industry-leading real-time object detection model, and we demonstrate that dendritic structures can reduce model size while maintaining accuracy.

## Project Impact - Required

YOLOv8 is deployed across mobile apps, industrial IoT, autonomous vehicles, and security systems. Edge deployment faces significant challenges:

- **Memory constraints**: YOLOv8n has 3.15M parameters requiring substantial RAM
- **Compute requirements**: High FLOP count limits inference speed on edge hardware  
- **Power consumption**: Intensive computation drains battery on mobile devices

Improving YOLOv8 efficiency enables smaller models for resource-constrained devices, faster inference for real-time edge detection, and lower power consumption for mobile battery life. This directly benefits applications like drone navigation, industrial quality control, and mobile AR/security systems.

## Usage Instructions - Required

**Installation:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Run with dendrites (local):**

```bash
python train_dendritic.py --epochs 5 --wandb
```

**Run baseline without dendrites:**

```bash
python train_baseline.py --epochs 5
```

**Or use the Colab notebook (recommended):**

Open `notebooks/dendritic_yolov8_clean.ipynb` in Google Colab with L4/T4 GPU runtime.

## Results - Required

This project demonstrates that Dendritic Optimization can compress YOLOv8n while maintaining detection accuracy. Comparing the baseline model to the dendritic model:

| Model | Parameters | mAP50-95 | Notes |
|-------|------------|----------|-------|
| YOLOv8n Baseline | 3.16M | 0.484 | Standard training |
| YOLOv8n Dendritic | 2.84M | 0.479 | With PerforatedAI dendrites |

**Percent Parameter Reduction:** 10.1%

**Analysis:** Dendrites reduced model size by 10.1% (from 3.16M to 2.84M parameters) with only a 1% decrease in mAP50-95. This trade-off is favorable for edge deployment where memory constraints are critical.
