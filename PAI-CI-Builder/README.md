# Dendritic Augmentation Examples

This folder contains working examples of how to add the dendrites to existing PyTorch systems.  Each repository contains full code and README's for running an example with the original code as well as the PAI code.  Each README contains results running the original repository and the results we got when running it with Dendritic Augmentation.  Original repositories are linked along with when we checked them out. To find modified files search for files with _perforatedai.py in their names.

General instructions for adding PAI to a system can be found in the [API](https://github.com/PerforatedAI/PerforatedAI/API) repository.  But the specific examples of where to put each function and how to use the customization functions can be found here to best implement the system into your training program.

## Contributing

We welcome any contributions to this folder.  Please look at the [mnist example](https://github.com/PerforatedAI/PerforatedAI/tree/main/Examples/baseExamples/mnist) for how to format a contribution.

## Licensing

Some example folders will be forks of other repos.  If those repos contain license files, the internal licenses only apply to the pre-existing code from the original folders, not any upstream code, or any _pai files within that folder.
